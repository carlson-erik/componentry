# Componentry

This repository holds all of the various React components that I've buiilt for fun. 

## Components 

### Order Summary Modal

**Description:** A Modal component with a detailed summary of an online order. The summary of the order includes a list of bought items, total price as well as order relevant details including Customer Name, Email, Phone, Delivery Address and Payment Details. The modal features a Header that shows the potential progression of views (see future plans) as well as Submit and Cancel buttons.

**Status:** MVP

**Future Plans:** I want to upgrade the Modal component handle going between multiple views. 

### User Profile 

**Description:** A component that shows a user's profile picture and relevant site stats below it. I could see this component turning into something large as a user profile "panel" or even a full blown profile component. The stats should be dynamic for greater reusability.

**Status:** Idea

### Pokedex

**Description:** Using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), build a Pokedex app. It should allow the user to view each pokemon availible as well as sorting by generation, type, evolution stage, etc. 

**Status:** Idea 

### Pricing

**Description:** A typical pricing component that shows 3 different pricing plans with one being highlighted as the preferred plan.

**Status:** Idea 

### Reviews

**Description:** A component that visually and literally shows the 1-5 star ratings and how many of them there are for a given product.

**Status:** Idea

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Runs Storybook.js as the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:9009/](http://localhost:9009/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
